A runner file for visibly demonstrating Gabbi features.

Given a list of files, read each one, display its contents
and present it to gabbi-run.

Need a running [gdemo](https://github.com/cdent/gabbi-demo)
server and an installed and available `gabbi-run` from
[gabbi](https://github.com/cdent/gabbi).
